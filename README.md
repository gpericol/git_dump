# GitDump ü•∑

GitDump is a tool for downloading and reconstructing Git repositories from disclosed `.git` directories. 

This project was inspired by [lijiejie's GitHack](https://github.com/lijiejie/GitHack), a fantastic tool that helped me during a HackTheBox CTF on Christmas night. While using GitHack, I found it incredibly useful, but I wanted to improve certain aspects like adding multi-threading support and making the output less verbose. So, I decided to create GitDump, a tool tailored to my needs.

Special thanks to [lijiejie](https://github.com/lijiejie) for the original inspiration!
